# CHC Cyberattack Analysis

## Overview

In **February 2024**, Change Healthcare, one of the largest processors of U.S. medical claims, was hit by a devastating cyberattack attributed to the **BlackCat/AlphV ransomware group**. Handling 15 billion claims annually and supporting nearly 40% of U.S. healthcare payments, Change Healthcare was forced to halt operations, leading to significant disruptions in patient care and financial stress on hospitals and healthcare providers.

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of the cyberattack, its impacts, and recommendations to strengthen cybersecurity defenses across the healthcare sector.

## Contents

### 1. **Final Deliverables**
   - A comprehensive report summarizing the root cause analysis, key findings, and recommendations for improving healthcare cybersecurity. It explores the anatomy of the attack, the role of social engineering, and lessons from other industries, particularly finance.

### 2. **Painpoint Analysis**
   - An Excel file that breaks down the key vulnerabilities within Change Healthcare’s infrastructure, focusing on critical areas such as the lack of **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**, outdated legacy systems, and insufficient incident management protocols.

### 3. **Presentation Slides**
   - A slide deck that provides a visual summary of the attack, highlighting the sequence of events, downstream impacts on the healthcare industry, and recommendations for future prevention. Key statistics include:
     - **98%** of attacks stemmed from social engineering tactics.
     - **$100 million** in daily losses due to system outages.
     - **33%** of Americans potentially had their healthcare data compromised.

## Key Insights

- **Social Engineering**: 98% of the attacks targeted Change Healthcare employees through social engineering techniques, exploiting weak passwords and a lack of awareness.
  
- **Lack of Governance**: The decentralized structure between Change Healthcare and its parent company, United Healthcare, left the organization vulnerable. Without a centralized governance model or incident response plan, the attack caused significant damage before being detected.

- **Downstream Impacts**: The attack resulted in delayed payments and disruptions to hospital operations, leading to financial instability and potential risks to patient care.

## Recommendations

1. **Invest in Cybersecurity**: Allocate more resources towards cybersecurity, drawing inspiration from the financial sector’s heavy investment in threat prevention (e.g., Bank of America’s $1 billion annual spend).
  
2. **Implement MFA**: Across all employee accounts and access points, enforce multi-factor authentication to significantly reduce the likelihood of unauthorized access.

3. **Enhance Training**: Conduct regular and mandatory cybersecurity awareness training for all healthcare employees to reduce vulnerabilities to phishing and other social engineering attacks.

4. **Foster Centralized Governance**: Establish a centralized security framework across all subsidiaries, ensuring real-time communication and collaboration between Change Healthcare and its parent company, United Healthcare, to prevent future breaches.

5. **Incident Response Playbook**: Develop and implement a comprehensive incident response plan that includes immediate containment protocols and the appointment of a Chief Incident Manager (CIM) to oversee crises.

## Conclusion

This repository serves as a vital resource for understanding the lessons learned from the Change Healthcare cyberattack and provides actionable solutions for the healthcare industry to better protect sensitive patient data and maintain operational resilience in the face of future cyber threats.
